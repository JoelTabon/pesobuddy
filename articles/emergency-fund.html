          Let’s be real—life in the Philippines can throw some serious
          curveballs. Whether it's a sudden hospital bill, getting laid off, or
          a busted motor, it pays (literally) to have an emergency fund. If
          you’re not sure where to start, don’t worry. This guide is for
          you—straightforward, walang halong echos.
        </p>

        <h2>What is an Emergency Fund?</h2>
        <p>
          In simple terms, an emergency fund is
          <strong>money you set aside for life's "uh-oh" moments</strong>. It's
          not for vacations, shopping, or your favorite milk tea. It's for real
          emergencies like medical issues, job loss, or unexpected repairs.
        </p>

        <h2>Why You Need One</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s the thing—emergencies are part of life. And when they come,
          they don’t wait for your next sweldo or 13th-month pay. Having an
          emergency fund means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You don’t need to utang from friends or loan apps.</li>
          <li>You avoid high-interest debt.</li>
          <li>You can sleep better at night knowing you have a backup.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Much Should You Save?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The golden rule:</strong> 3 to 6 months’ worth of your
          essential expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s say you spend ₱20,000/month on rent, food, bills, and transpo.
          You’ll want to save at least ₱60,000 to ₱120,000. It might seem a lot
          but it’s okay, you can start small.
        </p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Starting Your Emergency Fund</h2>

        <p>
          <strong
            ><span class="styled-number">1.</span> Track Your Spending:</strong
          >
          Before you save, know where your money goes. Use a notebook, Excel, or
          budgeting apps like Money Lover, Goodbudget, or even a simple Notes
          app.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            ><span class="styled-number">2.</span> Set a Monthly Saving
            Goal:</strong
          >
          Decide how much you can realistically set aside each payday. Again,
          before starting funding your emergency fund, try to pay off your high
          interest utang first.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re following the 50-30-20 rule to budget your salary, here’s
          how it usually works: 50% goes to your needs like rent, food, and
          bills, 30% for your wants like gala, online shopping, or Netflix, and
          20% goes to savings or investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let’s tweak that a bit — especially if you’re focused on building
          your emergency fund fast. Try this: keep 50% for your needs and wants
          combined. That means after covering your essentials, whatever’s left
          from that 50% is your allowance for wants. Then, set aside 30%
          directly for your emergency fund. With this setup, you’ll build your
          safety net in no time — promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the calculator below to see how much of your salary should go
          toward your emergency fund, using the 50-30-20 rule. Let’s make ipon
          goals happen, one paycheck at a time.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Starting an emergency fund doesn’t have to be intimidating. You don’t
          need to earn six figures to get started—just a plan, a bit of
          discipline, and a clear “why.” The earlier you start, the sooner
          you’ll feel more in control, even when life throws you a plot twist.
